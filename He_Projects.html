                            <h4>Computer Science Principles</h4>
                            <p>During the creative process of designing and creating the game, there were several useful 
                               tools and resources that helped make our game possible such as other Scratch games, previous 
                               experience with different types of games, and what we learned with how code(s) interacts with 
                               each other. As Rishi and I looked on Scratch for inspiration to start our game we came across 
                               a very barebones game called “Catch Food”, which as the name implies was a game that involved 
                               the player moving a bowl to catch food that fell out of the sky. This game was very useful to 
                               us because it showed us how to write the code such that our shark sprite would eat the food that 
                               fell and it helped tremendously with creating the final version of our game. Previous experience 
                               with other games, namely platformers, helped since it gave us an idea of how difficult it would 
                               be to create and program a certain type of game. This is why we decided to choose to create the 
                               sharkfeeder game over a platformer maze type game, as it was more suitable with the time constraints
                               and our limited knowledge with code. Also how code interacted with each other help since the different
                               interactions such as forever, if then, if then..else, and broadcast helped to allow the game’s controls
                               to keep on working throughout the entirety of the game and set certain events to occur when they were 
                               supposed to. ...More Data...

                            <h3>Space Invaders</h3>
                            <h4>Computer Science Principles</h4>
                            <p>From the very beginning of the development of our app we both quickly determined what we wanted to do 
                               with our game. After seeing the space invaders game tutorial we agreed that this would be a fun and 
                               interesting app to build and improve upon. Grace started our project strong by completing the tutorial
                               and looking into the code to see how every piece interacted with each other so that we could manipulate 
                               it later with more features. Inspired by the original Atari 64 and arcade space invaders we wanted to 
                               develop a more arcade style game with a pixelated start and end screen that had the space invaders visible.
                               A quick google search provided the images that we wanted to use and we coded the game to start when the 
                               introduction screen was touched and for the end screen to appear when the player lost. We gave our game
                               to be tested by our partners and the feedback from them gave us ideas for how to improve our game and 
                               troubleshoot the issues with the health and score value. After completing that step in development we 
                               also decided to make the enemy alien ships shot back at the player to make it more difficult and have 
                               an end to the game. It took a lot of tinkering around with since there were many glitchy interactions 
                               between the enemy alien bullet and the player’s bullet that made the game very easy to play, since a point
                               would be added every time they collided. We figured out how to change this by looking back at our previous
                               games and figured out that we needed to change how the interactions with the bullets worked through instead
                               of making it when the enemy alien ship and player sprite were hit by the ship, we made it that a point would
                               added every time the player bullet hit the enemy alien ship. This taught us the idea of how to program 
                               different interactions to fit different needs in our programs. The beta walk provided many good insights on
                               our game which we complied to improve our game such as increasing the difficulty of the game by setting the
                               enemy alien bullets to hone in on the player instead of simply just going straight down. ...More Data...
