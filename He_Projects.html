                                <p>In this Space Invaders App Inventor Project, our group's objective was to initially program a basic Space Invaders
                                   game and then further develop the game by adding unique features. In this project, I was primarily the programmer 
                                   on the software for the game while my partner, Grace Liu, aided in the documentation of the project. Throughout the 
                                   project, my partner and I kept a very consistent update log of the code over email to adjust to the inability of the 
                                   software for multiple devices to edit at the same time. We also kept each other accountable for the work that was 
                                   completed by filling in the daily log with all the changes and work that was done each day. Overall, I learned many 
                                   new interactions with the code and how to adapt to challenges with game breaking issues, such as clashing variables 
                                   in the code that made the game unplayable. We managed to fix these issues by taking suggestions from peers and doing 
                                   more research on the components within the code that we were manipulating.

                                <p>In this Python Text Adventure Project, our group's objective was to create a fully functional text adventure game in
                                   a python workspace. Throughout this project I was primarily the programmer that coded the text adventure and kept a 
                                   close line of communication with my partner to ensure that the project would be documented properly. Since the project
                                   was on a single python workspace it was important to know when each partner was working as to ensure that the changes
                                   that were made would not interfere with other pre-existing code. Overall, I learned many different interactions with 
                                   individually created functions that often broke my game, but allowed me to learn and improve my coding skills. This 
                                   project required great levels of consistency as to ensure that the game would not break or halt due to conflicting
                                   functions. Both my partner and I learned a great deal of python by fixing the issues that we encountered and changing
                                   how we wrote functions in python.
