                    <p><strong>Duty. Honor. Country.</strong> The motto of the United States Military Academy, West Point which describes the values found 
                       inside of all those chosen to go to attend the prestigious institute. I plan to enroll at West Point and pursue a 
                       major in history. Afterward, I plan on joining the United States Army for five years as per by law on active duty 
                       as a commissioned officer. Since my childhood, I have been a part of the Boy Scouts of America and rising in rank 
                       and leadership so that I may acquire the skills to help prepare myself for joining the United States Army. I have 
                       also kept my academics at an above average standard so that my chances of being accepted by West Point are higher.
                       The reason why I want to go to West Point is that the level of discipline and leadership is much higher than any 
                       other college or university and the sense of duty to my country gives me a desire to do the best that I can. This 
                       is because I feel that the time I would spend at West Point would be more inspiring and educational not simply in 
                       the subjects taught during the day, but through the hardships and challenges faced daily in the journey to becoming 
                       better.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the United States Army in any rank, it is important to be adaptable, cooperative, dependable, persistent, and 
                       much more. While I was in Taiwan teaching children English not everything went as smoothly as my team had hoped for,
                       but with my ability to be adaptable we managed to make the situation as good as it could be and never giving up 
                       despite difficulties. Through my experience at the National Youth Leadership Training camp, I learned how to effectively
                       partner with other people and discover their strengths such that working as a team would increase our abilities to 
                       complete challenges or fix issues. In my wrestling experience, it is not quite as simple as other sports but relies on 
                       the entire person to be strong and tactical in their approaches without giving up. Wrestling practice is daily and day 
                       after day it feels increasingly difficult to give your best efforts and many contemplate if it is worth it to do, but 
                       after countless hours of relentless exercise and training, I learned how to be persistent and not give up.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through high school, I have strived to push myself and learn to the highest degree of my abilities which is why I have 
                       been able to study in these college-level courses. The "Advanced Placement" college-level courses are in Human Geography,
                       Statistics, Chemistry, United States History, English Language/Composition, and Calculus AB with more to come in the 
                       following year. I have participated in many non-profit clubs and organizations such as Plushies Aimed to Comfort Hearts also
                       known as "PATCH" with donation drives and fundraisers at local venues. I am also currently a freshmen mentor who helps out 
                       first years in high school so that they may have a comfortable and enjoyable transition from middle school. From my work 
                       experience as a laboratory intern, I have learned the importance of paying attention to detail since inside of a laboratory 
                       it is key to not make even the tiniest mistakes since the true value that you are trying to find may be greatly altered. 
                       From being on the wrestling team, I have found that even though I may not be the fastest at learning new techniques I take 
                       the mistakes and losses that happen and learn from them as best as possible so that the next time I will be prepared and 
                       successful.
                    </p>
                    <p>All things considered, I am a well-rounded student who seeks different experiences so that I may become better than I 
                       was before. I thank you for taking the time out of your day to read through these several paragraphs about myself and 
                       hope you enjoy the rest of my website as you browse.
